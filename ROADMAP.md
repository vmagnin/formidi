    * [ ] Exploring 1/f music (Tangente). (**)

* [ ] Adding a first version of a FORD documentation. (**)

* [ ] Adding subroutines for serial music.

* [ ] A drum pattern object to ease programming rhythms, inspired by the pattern system used in `example/drum_machine.f90`. Could be also used by ForSynth. (***)
* [ ] A note sequencer repeating a pattern. Could be also used by ForSynth. (***)
* [ ] A sequence object, accepting a string with notes, with methods to obtain one by one their parameters (physical or MIDI). Could be also used by ForSynth. (***)
    * [ ] The sequence could for example be coded as "A4,Q.,pf;A#4,Q,pf;..." (note, length, intensity).
